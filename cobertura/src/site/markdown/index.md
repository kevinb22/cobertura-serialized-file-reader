# What is Cobertura?

<img src="images/yesPen.png" style="float:right" width="331" height="243"/> Cobertura is a free Java code coverage
reporting tool, originally based on jcoverage. Cobertura

Cobertura performs two main tasks:

1. **Check**. Cobertura can check the amount of lines and branches (possible execution paths) that are executed
			by your tests. In most build systems, Cobertura can use the result of checks to print information,
			warnings or even break the build if so instructed. This implies Cobertura can raise code quality by
			enforcing a minimum code coverage by automated tests.

2. **Report**. Cobertura can generate easy-to-read reports that illustrate which parts of your code has been
			covered by your automated tests. These reports can be generated by themselves, or as an integrated
			part of a generated site describing the project.

While cobertura can be run standalone, it is frequently integrated into build tools such as Maven or Ant.

## Running cobertura
Cobertura can be executed via build tools (Ant, Maven) and standalone from the command line.
